Features
========
I created this calculator because:
1. m48+ is no longer available on the Apple app store.
1. Droid48 is only available on Android.
1. Wanted cross-platform usability on iOS, Android, and web browsers.
1. Improve the HP48 calculator by taking advantage of dynamic CSS to reduce clutter and increase functionality.
1. Wanted something that looked absolutely freaking gorgeous so that it would be fun to use.
